<h2>Disallow duplicate properties</h2>
<p>
Early on in web development, including the same CSS property twice was certainly an error, especially if there were two different values. For example:
</p>
<pre>
.mybox {
    width: 100px;
    width: 120px;
}
</pre><p>
Anyone looking at this code would think that this is clearly an error. Recently, however, including duplicate properties is used as a way to deal with varying levels of browser support for CSS properties. For example, some browsers support RGBA color while others do not, so it's quite common to see patterns such as:
</p><pre>
.mybox {
    background: #fff;
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}
</pre><p>
This is quite clearly intentional. The developer wants to use RGBA when available but wants to fall back to a regular color when not available.
