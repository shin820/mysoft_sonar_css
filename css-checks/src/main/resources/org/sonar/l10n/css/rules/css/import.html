<h2>Disallow @import</h2>
<p>
The @import command is used to include CSS files within other CSS files, for example:
<pre>
@import url(more.css);
@import url(andmore.css);

a {
    color: black;
}
</pre>
This code includes two more style sheets at the beginning of a style sheet. When the browser parses this code, it stops at each @import and starts to download the specified file. The browser doesn't continue downloading other style sheets until this one has finished, eliminating any possible parallel downloads of CSS.
</p><p>
There are two alternatives to using @import:
<ol>
<li>Use a build system to concatenate CSS files together before deploying.</li>
<li>Use multiple <link> tags to include the style sheets you want. These will still be downloaded in parallel.</li>
</ol>
