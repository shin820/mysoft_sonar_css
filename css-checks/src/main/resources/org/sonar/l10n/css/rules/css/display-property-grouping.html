<h2>Require properties appropriate for display</h2>
<p>
Even though you can define any group of properties together in a CSS rule, some of them will be ignored due to the display of the element. This leads to extra cruft in your CSS and misunderstandings around how a rule should work.
</p><p>
For display: inline, the width, height, margin-top, margin-bottom, and float properties have no effect because inline elements don't have a formal box with which to apply the styles. The margin-left and margin-right properties still work reliably for indentation purposes but the other margin settings do not. The float property is sometimes used as a fix for the IE6 double-margin bug.
</p><p>
Other general rules based on display are:
<ul>
<li>display: inline-block should not use float.</li>
<li>display: block should not use vertical-align.</li>
<li>display: table-* should not use margin (and all variants) or float.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Removed the ignored or problematic properties decreases file size thereby improving performance.
