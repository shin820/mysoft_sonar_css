<h2>Require compatible vendor prefixes</h2>
<p>
Experimental CSS properties are typically implemented using vendor prefixes
 until the final behavior has been established and agreed upon. Most CSS3
 properties have vendor-prefixed equivalents for multiple vendors,
 including Firefox (<pre>-moz</pre>), Safari/Chrome (<pre>-webkit</pre>),
 Opera (<pre>-o</pre>), and
 Internet Explorer (<pre>-ms</pre>). It's easy to forget to include the vendor
 prefixed version of a property when there are so many to keep track of.</p>
