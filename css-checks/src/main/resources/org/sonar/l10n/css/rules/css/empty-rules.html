<h2>Disallow empty rules</h2>
<p>
An empty rule is one that doesn't contain any properties, such as:
</p>
<pre>
.foo {
}
</pre>
<p>
A lot of times, empty rules appear as a result of refactoring without further cleanup. Eliminating empty rules results in smaller file sizes and less style information for the browser to deal with.
