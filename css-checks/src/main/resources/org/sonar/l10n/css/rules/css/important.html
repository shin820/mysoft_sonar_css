<h2>Disallow !important</h2>
<p>
The !important annotation is used to artificially increase the specificity of a given property value in a rule. This is usually an indication that the specificity of the entire CSS has gotten a bit out of control and needs to be refactored. The more frequently !important is found in CSS, the more likely it is that developers are having trouble styling parts of a page effectively.

Example:
<pre>
.mybox {
    color: red !important;
}
</pre>
